  - [ ] `DEMO_MODE=true`
  - [ ] `COMPANY_NAME=EcoTech Solutions`
- [ ] Wait for deployment to complete
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `https://your-backend.railway.app/health`
- [ ] Test API docs: `https://your-backend.railway.app/docs`
- [ ] **Copy backend URL** for frontend configuration

## Frontend Service Deployment

- [ ] Add new service to same Railway project
- [ ] Connect to same GitHub repository
- [ ] Set root directory to `frontend/` (if needed)
- [ ] Configure environment variables:
  - [ ] `NODE_ENV=production`
  - [ ] `REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app` ‚ö†Ô∏è **Update with actual URL**

- [ ] Set up monitoring/alerts (optional)

## Common Issues Checklist

If something isn't working:

- [ ] Check Railway deployment logs
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Ensure frontend `REACT_APP_API_URL` matches backend URL exactly
- [ ] Confirm WebSocket URL uses `wss://` protocol
- [ ] Test backend health endpoint independently
- [ ] Check browser console for client-side errors
- [ ] Verify CORS is configured (should work automatically)

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test backend health
curl https://your-backend.railway.app/health
